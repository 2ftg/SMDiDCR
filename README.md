# SMDiDCR
SMD Direct conversion receiver based on N2CQR's design  
This is my SMD variant of Bill N2CQR's "iPhone Direct Conversion Receiver with Variable Ceramic Oscillator" receiver design.  
The original post with schematics can be found here:

My take on this is to transfer the design to SMD and attempt to stuff it in to a 50x50mm doublesided pcb from china.  
Some simple audio filtering and  integrated low noise audio amplifier which is not lm386 is also planed.  
All depending on how much of it will fit the pcb.
